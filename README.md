# SQL Project- Covid 19 Analysis 
# Domain : Data Analysis
# Tools : SQL, Microsoft Excel
The portfolio project focuses on analyzing various aspects of the COVID-19 
pandemic using SQL queries. The project begins by examining the likelihood of 
death upon contracting the virus, the percentage of the population infected, and the 
global trends in cases and deaths. It then delves into vaccination data, comparing 
total population to the number of individuals receiving vaccinations and creating 
visualizations to aid in understanding vaccination progress over time. The project 
utilizes SQL functions such as partitioning and common table expressions to 
efficiently process and analyze large datasets. By creating views and tables, the 
project structures the data for future analysis and visualization, demonstrating a 
comprehensive approach to understanding the impact and response to the 
pandemic.

Through SQL queries and data manipulation, the project provides insights into the 
spread of COVID-19 and the vaccination efforts across different locations and 
continents. By examining death rates, population infection rates, and vaccination 
coverage, the project sheds light on the effectiveness of public health measures and 
vaccination campaigns in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. The use of SQL 
functions and techniques showcases the ability to derive meaningful insights from 
complex datasets, facilitating informed decision-making and policy planning in 
response to the ongoing global health crisis. Overall, the project demonstrates the 
power of SQL in analyzing real-world data to gain valuable insights into complex 
phenomena like the COVID-19 pandemic
